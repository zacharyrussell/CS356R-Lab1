# Lab1: Time-Frequency Analysis
## Goal
Examination of signals in both the time and frequency domains, and observation of each domain's benefits understanding the structure of a given signal. We will also briefly touch upon signal modeling concepts, which are used to approximate certain signals through knowledge of their underlying structure. The context of our exercises will be examining a recorded song from a piece of piano music, and an attempt to synthesize that music.

## Prelab Exercises: Understanding Sample Period, Exponential Damping, and the FFT Function
Before we enter Lab 1 and examine signals created by a piano, we need to provide some additional background that will help us in our future analysis.
* To understand the concept of sample period, type the following commands in
MATLAB:
	```MATLAB
	Fs = 22050; % sample frequency in Hz
	Ts = 1/Fs; % sample period in seconds
	t = (1:1000)*Ts; % time vector with 1001 samples
	y = 0.5*sin(2*pi*330*t); % sine wave with amplitude 0.5 and frequency 330 Hz
	plot(t,y);
	```
	You should see a Figure 1 plot that appears as below. Note that the amplitude of the sine wave is easily seen to be 0.5, but that its frequency of 330 Hz requires more work to verify. To do so, note that the period of the sine wave should be 1/330 Hz = 0.003 seconds. To verify that the sine wave period is indeed that value, type `axis([0 0.003 -1 1])` in MATLAB and observe the resulting plot.  
	![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27924407/211992536-ff1757d3-3536-4c78-86cc-d52a14deea2c.png)
	
	In the above example, we see that sample period corresponds to the increment between each time sample in the vector `t` that we created. To better understand this concept, consider the following two examples:

	* `t = 1:1000` creates a vector `[1 2 3 ..... 1000]`
    * `t = (1:1000)*Ts` creates a vector `[1*Ts 2*Ts 3*Ts .... 1000*Ts]`
	
	We also see that sample frequency simply corresponds to the inverse of sample period. Note that the sine wave frequency and period differ from the sample frequency and period. When the sample frequency is much higher than the sine wave frequency (or, equivalently, where the sample period is much lower than the sine wave period), the sampled waveform resembles a continuous-time waveform.

* To  understand the concept of exponential damping, type the following commands in MATLAB:
	```MATLAB
	tau = 7e-3;
	r = exp(-t/tau);
	plot(t,r);
	```
	You should see a plot as shown below, which displays the decaying exponential function as a function of time. The rate of decay is set by the time constant of the exponential, which corresponds to variable tau in the above example. Try different values of `tau` in the above example to see how it influences the decay time of the exponential.  
	![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27924407/211993801-c78b58cd-0744-4b71-ae27-39e67e9a15ed.png) 
	
	The decaying exponential that you are seeing above is not the same as the complex exponentials. While the above plot shows a decaying exponential, the expression that exponential damping is typically associated with is a non-exponential waveform whose amplitude decays in an exponential fashion. A very relevant example is the exponential damping of a sine wave, as illustrated by executing the following MATLAB commands (with tau = 7e-3):
	```MATLAB
	y_damped = sin(2*pi*330*t).*exp(-t/tau);
	plot(t,y_damped);
	```
	After execution of the above command, you should see the plot below. Be
sure to note the use of the two characters `.*` in the above example – the
`.*` character combination is used when multiplying two vectors on an element-by-element basis. Try changing `tau` to a few different values to see the resulting waveform changes.

	![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27924407/211994296-773359f4-a62f-48aa-974c-ad9e5f3a46db.png)

* To see the frequency domain content of a given signal in MATLAB, we typically use the function `fft` (which stands for Fast Fourier Transform). The `fft` operates on non-periodic signals which are sampled in time and have finite length. The output of the `fft` is very similar to what we would expect from doing the Fourier Series of a periodic signal – we essentially obtain `a` and `b` coefficients which can be examined to see the frequency content of a given signal.
	* In MATLAB, type `edit fft_example.m`
	* Answer yes when prompted for the creation of a new file. 
	* Within the new edit window, type in the following commands, save and run the script.
		```MATLAB
		t = 0:19;
		f = -10:9; % use index of frequencies for easy viewing in stem plot
		y = sin(2*pi*1/20*t); % sine wave with frequency 1/20
		yf = fft(y);
		a = real(yf); % a coefficients of Fourier Transform
		b = imag(yf); % b coefficients of Fourier Transform
		subplot(221); % left, upper corner of 2x2 plot
		stem(f,fftshift(a)); % make stick figure plot, fftshift used to properly show positive and negative frequencies
		title('a coeff');
		subplot(222); % right, upper corner of 2x2 plot
		stem(f,fftshift(b));
		title('b coeff');
		subplot(223); % left, lower corner of 2x2 plot
		stem(f,fftshift(abs(yf))); % magnitude of fft coefficients, i.e., sqrt(a2 + b2)
		title('magnitude')
		```
	* You should now see a plot as shown below. Notice that for the sine wave signal, the `a` coefficients are all essentially zero (notice the scale is 1e-15), whereas the `b` coefficients have non-zero values only for index values of +1 and -1 (which correspond to frequencies of +1/20 and -1/20). Notice that the magnitude plot is even symmetric about zero frequency, and the phase plot is odd symmetric about zero frequency.  
	  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27924407/212124124-83baef07-dbd0-4c5e-a9a6-67d3f24904b7.png)  	
	
* To better see when the a or b coefficients are essentially zero, add the following
axis commands to the above script. Upon re-running the
script, you should see the plot shown below.
	```MATLAB
	...
	title('a coeff');
	axis([-10 10 -10 10]); % add this command
	...
	title('b coeff');
	axis([-10 10 -10 10]); % add this command
	...
	```
	![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27924407/212124388-f60ea95c-599b-407f-9d9f-a9c4046b0248.png)
		
* Now change y in the above script from a sine to a cosine waveform and then re-
run the script to the plot shown below:		
	```MATLAB
	...
	y = cos(2*pi*1/20*t); % cosine wave with frequency 1/20
	....
	```

	![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27924407/212124688-494e34ae-9ee5-4dad-a654-772cde62aa11.png)
	
	The above plot reveals that the b coefficients are now zero.

* Finally, double the frequency of the cosine waveform and re-run the script to get
the plot shown below:
	```MATLAB
	.....
	y = cos(2*pi*1/10*t); % cosine wave with frequency 1/10
	.....
	```
	
	![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27924407/212125235-42f2691d-98ef-4f83-957b-74fc830890d2.png)
	
	The above plot shows that the frequency content of the signal has shifted to index values of +2 and -2 (which correspond to frequencies +2/20 and -2/20).

* As we complete our exercise on the fft function, we mention a few things that will
useful to know in the remaining exercises in this lab:
	* Notice that we did not bother plotting the phase of the fft coefficients in the
above examples. For many applications, the magnitude of the fft is of
primary importance, and, in such cases, we rarely look at the phase or even
the a and b coefficients themselves.
	* Since the magnitude is always even symmetric, we often just focus on the
positive frequency range.

## Lab Exercises
### Background on Piano Music  
Pressing a piano's key causes a hammer to strike a set of taut strings; the hammer then falls away from the strings so as not to dampen their vibration. The vibration of the  strings produces the sound that we hear and recognize as the strike of a piano’s key. The quality of the sound we hear is determined by the amplitude and frequency of the string’s vibration, which in turn are related to the length, diameter, tension and density of the string. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27924407/211731280-ecfd81c5-2865-411a-b580-34eb3f0d0770.png)

Most pianos have 88 keys, with the leftmost key producing the lowest frequency sound. The keys on a piano are arranged in a repeating pattern of 12 keys (7 white and 5 black) as shown below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27924407/211731379-b78d71b5-6b27-4818-b982-0b795cb99ccf.png)


Each of the 12 keys in a pattern corresponds to a note in the twelve-note Western Music  Scale. The seven white keys correspond to the seven natural notes ( C, D, E, F, G, A, B);  and the remaining 5 black keys correspond to the sharp and  flat notes (C#  /Db , D#  /Eb, F#  /Gb, G#  /Ab, A#  /Bb). In this lab, we will focus only on the seven natural notes.

A note that is one octave above another has a frequency that is twice the frequency of the lower note. To distinguish between the different octaves, we often add a subscript to each note to indicate the octave it belongs to. For example, the leftmost C<sub>1</sub>  note on a  piano has a frequency of 32.7 Hz, whereas the C<sub>2</sub> note is one octave above C<sub>1</sub> and has a frequency of 65.4 Hz.  The figure below lists the frequencies of the keys that will be of interest in this lab.

### Time-Domain Analysis of Piano Notes
We begin our analysis of piano notes by looking at their time-domain waveform. To do so, we’ll load a snippet from a song played from a piano and examine its basic structure.

* Open the project directory in MATLAB.
* Execute the following commands.
	```MATLAB
	Fs = 22050;  % sample frequency of music snippet  
	load Sample_1;  % load music snippet file  
	soundsc(Sample_1,Fs); % play the music snippet on the headphones
	t= (1:length(Sample_1))/Fs;  
	plot(t, Sample_1);  % plot the waveform
	```
* Upon executing the above commands, you should hear the note on the PC headphones and then see the waveform as shown below:  
	![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27924407/211889527-be19453d-e316-44ad-8caa-1d760317c1ce.png)	
* We see from the plot above that the amplitude of the signal decays with time. Let us now consider modeling this decay as exponential damping. To do so, we need to figure out the time constant of the exponential decay,  tau. In this case, we will simply tell you that `tau = 0.5` seconds ends up being a pretty good fit. To verify that this value works pretty well, type in the following MATLAB commands:  
	```MATLAB
	tau = 0.5;  % the time constant value we have given you  
	r = 0.08*exp(-t/tau);  % create exponential decay waveform  
	plot(t, Sample_1, t, r, t, -r)
	```
* Upon executing the above commands, you should see the plot below. Note that while the assumption of exponential damping is not a perfect fit, it is a nice engineering approximation that we will assume for the rest of this lab.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27924407/211889756-0563f6ff-8278-4b4b-b7fb-e024f37696c9.png)
* Now let us look more closely at the above signal by zooming in on the signal segment between 0.6 and 0.7 seconds. At the MATLAB prompt, type `axis([0.6 0.7 -0.03 0.03])` which yields the plot below:    
	 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27924407/211889988-f5a3bd15-aeaa-4f52-8026-3744424b0fe9.png)
* From the zoomed-in plot above, we observe that the signal is periodic in nature. Unfortunately, it is difficult to figure out the frequencies associated with the above signal based on its time-domain plot. That is a task better suited for frequency-domain analysis, as we will now explore.

### Frequency-Domain Analysis of Piano Notes
* We will now use the MATLAB `fft` function to more directly examine the frequency content of the piano note examined in the previous section. In particular, we will be looking at the magnitude of the `fft` output, focusing on positive frequencies when plotting.
* Assuming you just ran the MATLAB commands from the previous section, continue by typing in the following commands:
	```MATLAB
	yf = fft(Sample_1); % perform fft on music snippet
	f = (0:length(yf)-1)*Fs/length(yf); % We will not be using fftshift() to view negative frequencies, so frequency should span 0 to Fs Hz with a little adjustment to keep length same as yf.
	plot(f,abs(yf));
	axis([0 500 0 200]); % look at frequency range from 0 to 500 Hz
	```
	
	* The resulting frequency-domain plot shown below reveals the frequencies of the periodic waveform displayed in the previous section. In particular, we see that there are sine/cosine components present at several different frequencies and that the relative magnitude at those different frequencies varies significantly from each other. Without having phase information, we cannot tell what the relative contribution of sine versus cosine components is in making up the overall magnitude at each frequency value. The good news is that the phase information is essentially irrelevant in terms of how you will hear the music on the headphones. Therefore, for the analysis to follow, we will simply assume that only sine waveforms are present and 	ignore any cosine contribution. This decision is arbitrary – we could just as easily have chosen cosine components instead.

	    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27924407/211891490-cb82094e-29a1-492d-b570-424c758731e8.png)
	* Looking at the above plot in more detail, we see that the key frequency components are at 130Hz, 195Hz, 260Hz, 330Hz, and 390 Hz (we’ll make this fact clearer in the section below). Using the list of key frequencies shown in the figure in the background section, we determine that the musical notes corresponding to the observed frequency components are C3, G3, C4, E4, and G4. Observe that the note pairs {C3 C4} and {G3 G4} differ in frequency by a factor of two, and that the amplitude of C3 > C4 and the amplitude of G3 > G4. This implies that C3 is a fundamental note and C4 is its second harmonic (or overtone); and that G3 is another fundamental note and G4 is its second harmonic.

* One can see from the above exercise that frequency-domain analysis offers a very powerful tool in examining the structure of a given waveform. For example, knowledge of the various frequencies shown in the above plot allowed us to figure out which piano keys were pressed. Such a task would be very difficult when looking at the time-domain view of the signals. However, the time-domain view offers a different advantage – one readily sees the exponential damping of the signal (at least in an approximate manner), and we gain a sense of how the piano note decays in time. Therefore, one should consider time and frequency domain analysis as being complementary – each offers its own advantages when trying to observe the structure of a signal.

### Signal Modeling and Synthesis of Piano Notes

The power of understanding the structure of a signal is that we can use such knowledge to build a model of the signal, which in turn can be used to synthesize similar signals. In this lab, we will seek to build a simple model of the waveforms produced when various piano keys are played, and then use that model to construct our own version of a piano song. We start with a model based on Fourier concepts, and then simplify it further in order to make the synthesis task easier. Fourier concepts tell us that we can model the piano note we examined above as the sum of weighted sine and cosine components. However, to accurately represent the decaying amplitude of the piano notes with non-decaying sine and cosine waveforms, we would need to have a large number of those sine and cosine components. Therefore, let us instead consider directly modeling the decaying amplitude by assuming that the piano notes consist of a small number of sine waveforms with exponential damping (as discussed in Prelab). As mentioned earlier, the irrelevance of phase for this application means that we could pick either sine or cosine waveforms to work with – our choice of using sine waveforms is arbitrary. We now express our signal model mathematically as:  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27924407/211891831-c27fe871-748a-4843-a457-794668b71e16.png)  
where y(t) is assumed to be the piano note signal of interest. We call this a parametric
signal model since we need to determine the values of its corresponding parameters to represent the given signal. In the above case, the parameters of the model are the number of sinusoids N; the amplitude of each sinusoid b<sub>i</sub>; the frequency of each sinusoid f<sub>i</sub>; and the rate τ at which sinusoids decay.

Let us use this model to reconstruct the piano note we have been investigating. To help us with this task, we will use a MATLAB function called `ginput`. You may want to type `help ginput` at the MATLAB prompt to get more information on this command. 
* Assuming that you just ran the MATLAB commands from the previous section so
that the Figure 1 plot appears as shown on the previous page, continue by typing
in `[f,b] = ginput(5)`.
	* After executing the above command, place the cursor within the Figure 1 plot window and then left-click on each peak. After you have clicked on each of the 5 peaks, you should see values for the f and b vectors appear
which are similar in value to:
        ```
        f = [130 195 261 328 390]
        b = [98 150 61 135 70]
        ``` 
	* Note that the `f` vector values are in Hz, and the `b` vector values have significance only with respect to their relative values for our purposes here. 
	* We can relate the above frequency values to those associated with the various
piano keys. Using the frequency table shown on page 10, we obtain:
	
	    130 Hz: C3 , 195 Hz: G3 , 261 Hz: C4 , 328 Hz: E4 , 390 Hz: G4
* Let us now plug in the above parameter values to the parametric model discussed above. Within MATLAB, continue the previous set of commands by executing
    ```MATLAB
    tau = 0.5; % note that we provided you with this value of tau earlier
    ysin = b(1)*sin(2*pi*f(1)*t) + b(2)*sin(2*pi*f(2)*t) + b(3)*sin(2*pi*f(3)*t) + b(4)*sin(2*pi*f(4)*t) + b(5)*sin(2*pi*f(5)*t);
    y = ysin.*exp(-t/tau);
    soundsc(y,Fs);
    plot(t,y);
    ```
	* You should hear the synthesized piano note in the headphones, and you should see a plot similar to what is shown below:
	![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27924407/211982033-58312f59-f0ed-4fcb-939c-e9d4b4605a1d.png)
	
	* To see the frequency content of the above waveform, type the following command to see the plot shown below. Note that the absolute magnitudes are significantly different than the actual piano music, but the relative magnitudes are closely matched. In the interest of time, we’re not going to get into the issue of why the absolute magnitudes are different since it will 	not affect the key results we seek.
	``` MATLAB
	yf = abs(fft(y));
	f = (0:length(yf)-1)*Fs/length(yf);
	plot(f,yf);
	axis([0 500 0 max(yf)]);
	```
	![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27924407/211983041-b3d58eca-f503-4aaa-800e-ff9e53eb9764.png)
	
	* One should note that the sound is lacking the richness of the actual piano note. To hear the difference, type `soundsc(Sample_1,Fs)` at the MATLAB prompt to hear the actual piano notes again. The difference is because we are approximating the piano note with only five sine waves and are ignoring frequency content above 500 Hz. However, for this lab, we'll assume our approximation is close enough to get the basic ideas across.
	
### An Even Simpler Model for our Synthesized Piano Notes
While we could directly use the parameterized model from the previous section to analyze the piano song we are about to examine, it would be a bit dull to simply pick off frequency and amplitude values using ginput(). Instead, we seek a more physically motivated parameterization that will allow us to connect the waveforms we see to the keys actually pressed on the piano.

In the previous section, we determined that the frequencies from Sample_1 correspond to piano notes C3 , G3 , C4 , E4 , and G4. However, it is important to note that C4 and G4 are second harmonics of C3 and G3, respectively. Therefore, we can think of C3 , G3 and E4 as fundamental notes and C4, G4 as second harmonics or overtones. The musician very likely only played the fundamental notes C3, G3, and E4, as indicated in the figure below. We know this because it is common to play notes in groups of three, known as chords or triads. The harmonics of each fundamental note are heard because striking the piano string associated with a fundamental note sets up string vibrations at the fundamental note frequency and at integer multiples of that frequency.  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27924407/211983253-3e92a887-1890-49d5-aca0-70d438e22fde.png)

* Continuing our chain of MATLAB commands, let us now change our parameterized model for the Sample_1 snippet to be based on three fundamental keys and their second harmonics. As a crude approximation, we’ll simply assume that the fundamentals have the same amplitude and that the harmonics have 1/2 the amplitude of their respective fundamentals. Within MATLAB, type:

	```MATLAB
	c3f = 130.81; % frequency of note c3
	g3f = 196; % frequency of note g3
	e4f = 329.63; % frequency of note e4
	hm = 0.5; % relative magnitude of harmonic
	c3h = sin(2*pi*c3f*t) + hm*sin(2*pi*2*c3f*t); % sine wave: c3 & harmonic
	g3h = sin(2*pi*g3f*t) + hm*sin(2*pi*2*g3f*t); % sine wave: g3 & harmonic
	e4h = sin(2*pi*e4f*t) + hm*sin(2*pi*2*e4f*t); % sine wave: e4 & harmonic
	c3 = c3h.*exp(-t/tau); % include exponential damping
	g3 = g3h.*exp(-t/tau);
	e4 = e4h.*exp(-t/tau);
	y = c3 + g3 + e4;
	soundsc(y,Fs);
	plot(t,y);
	```
* Execution of the above commands should allow you to hear the synthesized
notes on the headphones. You should also see a plot similar to what is shown
below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27924407/211983462-47642e33-ebb4-4500-9373-04700098c190.png)

### A Composition Script for MATLAB
For the exercises to follow, you will be filling into a MATLAB script which provides you with variables for all the piano notes of interest. In particular, you will be using the skills you have learned thus far in this lab to analyze a short piano song and then synthesize it using the simplified signal model introduced in the previous section. Before we describe the exercises below, let us first look at this script so that you get a feeling of what it provides.

* In MATLAB, type `edit compose_song.m`.
* The first portion of this file contains some basic parameters like the time duration of note, the exponential damping time constant, and the relative harmonic magnitudes. As stated in the file, you’ll initially keep these values unchanged as you complete the first exercise. Note that duration simply corresponds to the approximate time that a note is played before a new note occurs – examination of the above plot shows that 1.6 seconds is a reasonable estimate of this value.

	```MATLAB
	duration = 1.6; % time duration of each note (in seconds)
	tau = .5; % damping time constant
	hm = 0.5; % relative magnitude of harmonic
	```
* The second section provides variables for each of the relevant piano keys, which are composed of their fundamental and second harmonic waveforms and are labeled c2, d2, e3, etc. These variables will be used to construct the synthesized song that we will seek.
* The third section provides placeholders for the chords that you will figure out in the exercises below. The value for chord1 is already provided, and corresponds to the Sample_1 snippet that we examined earlier.
* The final section strings together the chords, plays them on the headphones, and plots the time-domain waveform of the song.

### Exercises
**Exercise 1**  
Here you will listen to eight notes from a piano song, determine which notes are being played, and then synthesize the song using the simplified parameterized model from Section F. To do so, you will be running one script to hear and analyze the song (play_song.m), and filling in a different script (compose_song.m) to synthesize the song. You will be limited to three notes per chord – note that these notes may be harmonically related to each other in some cases.

* In MATLAB, type `play_song`. You should hear eight chords of a song, and the Figure 1 plot window should show both the time and frequency domain views of the song. The time-domain view progresses along and keeps a record of the entire song as it plays. The frequency-domain view shows the fft results one chord at a time. Re-run the above script a few times to hear the song and see the information that it provides.
* In MATLAB, type `edit play_song.m`. Within the edit window, uncomment the `pause` statement that is close to the end of the script. This will allow you to step through the chords one at a time. Be sure to save the file when you are done.
* Re-run the `play_song` script in MATLAB. You will notice that the script now pauses after each note. In order to progress to the next note, you must push a key on the PC keyboard (e.g., spacebar).
* You have three choices for picking off the frequency values from the MATLAB plot. One is to use the zoom button within the Figure 1 plot window (which appears as a magnifying glass with a plus symbol inside of it, as circled on the left below). The next is to hit Ctrl-C to stop the script at a given place, and then use `ginput` as discussed earlier. The third is to enable Data Tips under the Tools menu on the plot.
	* Given the information that you see in the Figure 1 plot window for each chord, determine three appropriate piano keys for each chord played. Assume that each key has equal magnitude as assumed for chord1 in Section F.
		```
		// Fill in the chords here:
		Chord 1: C3 G3 E4
		Chord 2:
		...
		Chord 8:
		```
	* Given the piano key keys determined above, edit the compose_song.m file to synthesize your song.
	
**Exercise 2**  
Here we make the task more open-ended and simply ask you to try to improve the signal modeling within the compose_song.m file in order to make the synthesized song sound truer to the actual song. However, you must limit yourself to 3 piano
notes per chord. Therefore, the parameters you have available to change are as follows:
* `duration`, `tau`, and `hm`: these allow you to change the duration of the notes, the time constant of the exponential damping, and the relative magnitude of the second harmonic.
* The relative scaling of notes: we previously constrained you to chords being composed of equal amplitude notes (i.e., `c3 + g3 + e4`), but you may now weight them differently (i.e., `0.7*c3 + g3 + 0.7*e4`).
* The number of harmonics associated with each note: we have thus far only included the second harmonic – you may also add additional harmonics if you like and scale them by whatever factor you like. However, all harmonics must be consistently scaled relative to their fundamental (i.e.., all second harmonics must be scaled relative to their fundamental by factor `hm`, and all third harmonics would need to be scaled relative to their fundamental by factor `hm3`, etc.).
* Modify the parameters until you are satisfied with your improved song.
* Measure the similarity of the original song and your synthesized song using Cosine Similarity and plot the [Cross-Correlation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/xcorr.html) of the two signals.
	```
	// Report the cosine similarity measure and add the cross-correlation plot here.
	```

## Post-Lab Discussion ##
// Add your answers below. 

* Q1: Is it easier to look at the issue of exponential damping in the time or frequency domain? Why?
* Q2: Is it easier to determine which note was played in the time or frequency domain? Why?
* Q3: If the time constant of exponential damping is reduced, does that imply that the note lasts for a longer or shorter period of time?
* Q4: How might you apply what you learned in this lab to looking into the areas of speech recognition and automatic note detection for arbitrary musical pieces? What would be additional challenges? Why?
